## Using docker and fleet to do data analysis

These folders contain some of the scripts we use to create docker containers,
push them to our local registry and fleet units to run these containers in a
CoreOS cluster.

Specifically, these will allow you to launch Zookeeper, Mesos, Chronos and HDFS
on a group of computers using fleet.
